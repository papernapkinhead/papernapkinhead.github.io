## Heading 1.1
This is a trial post to test out several things:
- Writing a post in Ulysses on iPad
- Saving directly to Mac via Secure Shellfish
- Using git to commit change to GitHub
I also want to make sure that organizing entries into folders within the `_posts` directory works. 
OK, bye for now :)
